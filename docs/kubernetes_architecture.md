1. Why K3s?
It's a lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution that is easy to install and manage, making it perfect for getting started and for resource-constrained environments - like the servers I use and want to keep it cheap


2. Why 2 servers - master and worker
Splitting to master and worker server ensures better stability and scalability because workloads don't interfere with cluster's management.
